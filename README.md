# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project
> Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age. 

### Resources and Before Start Notes:

* Data Source: `Employee_Database_challenge.sql`
* Data Tools: PostgreSQL, pgAdmin
* Software: pgAdmin 4.26, Python 3.8.3, Visual Studio Code 1.50.0, Flask Version 1.0.2

## Results

* This is an entity relationship diagram (ERD), also known as an entity relationship model, is a graphical representation that depicts relationships among people, objects, places, concepts or events within an information technology system.
- This ERD shows the tables are connected by the charts primary keys

* This is a chart that shows all the candidates that qualify for the new mentoring program for employees getting ready to retire. The mentorship program offers experienced and successful employees stepping back into a part-time role instead of retiring completely. They can be referenced as "senior" employees amongst the general staff. 
-The chart shows the employees number, department, and first and last names. This order also makes it easier to search a specific employee

* This chart has shown that there are more employees in the company that hold senior positions, then anything entry level. 64% of the staff hold senior positions

* The departments with the highest number of potential retirees are Development(25.45%),Production(22.30%) and Sales(7.27%).

## Summary

- There are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. 64% of the staff holds senior positions, so yes there is more then enough reitiement ready employees to train the next generation of employees. But since the majority of their staff are retirement ready, they're going to need an extensive hiring process and as well as a training program for the new commers.
